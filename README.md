Now available to play at https://snake-game-saurabh.netlify.app/

##### Design the elements
- Snake
- Food


### Features & Requirements

- At the start, theÂ snake will have a total length of 2.
- The snake will grow as it ate the food. 1 food = 1 length
- Show the total score of the user
- Game over when the snake touches the boundary.
- Game over when the snake eats itself.


### Tech Stack
- Use [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) for building the game
- Write test cases using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)+[React testing library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)
- I'll suggest to using [Mobx](https://mobx.js.org/README.html) for state management but the developer can choose which library they want to use.
- Use functional component instead of class components.
